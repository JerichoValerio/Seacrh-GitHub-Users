The term API stands for application programming interface, a concept that applies everywhere from command-line tools to enterprise code, microservices, and cloud-native architectures. 
An API is an interface that software developers use to programmatically interact with software components or resources outside of their own code.
An even simpler definition is that an API is the part of a software component that is accessible to other components.
